# MQTT Module Production Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the production-level improvements made to the custom MQTT module to address data integrity issues and improve stability.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Zbus Data Race Conditions
**Problem**: The original code read from zbus channels without proper error checking and synchronization, leading to potential garbage data.

**Solution**: 
- Added proper error checking for `zbus_chan_read()` operations
- Implemented mutex-based synchronization to prevent concurrent access
- Added logging for failed channel reads

### 2. Data Validation Issues
**Problem**: Insufficient validation allowed invalid sensor readings (0,0 measurements, out-of-range values) to be transmitted.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced range validation for all sensor types:
  - Temperature: -50°C to 100°C  
  - Humidity: 0% to 100%
  - Pressure: 80kPa to 120kPa
  - Battery: 0% to 100%
  - GPS accuracy: max 10km
- Added NaN/infinite value detection
- Implemented coordinate validation for GPS data

### 3. Memory Management Issues
**Problem**: Potential memory leaks and improper JSON handling could cause instability.

**Solution**:
- Consistent use of `cJSON_free()` instead of `free()`
- Proper cleanup in all error paths
- Added NULL pointer checks for all JSON operations

### 4. Power Data Structure Mismatch
**Problem**: Code tried to access `voltage` and `level` fields that don't exist in `power_msg`.

**Solution**:
- Updated to use correct `percentage` field from `power_msg` structure
- Added proper validation for battery percentage values

### 5. Thread Safety Issues
**Problem**: Multiple threads could access shared MQTT context simultaneously.

**Solution**:
- Added mutex protection for all shared data access
- Implemented proper locking around MQTT operations
- Protected sequence number and failure counter updates

### 6. Missing Error Recovery
**Problem**: No proper recovery mechanism for MQTT failures.

**Solution**:
- Implemented exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
- Added publish failure tracking and recovery
- Enhanced state machine error handling
- Added connection timeout handling

## New Features

### 1. Enhanced Diagnostics
- Added sequence numbers to all published messages
- Implemented publish failure tracking
- Added heap usage monitoring in heartbeat messages
- Enhanced logging with sequence numbers and failure counts

### 2. Production Configuration
- Centralized configuration constants in `custom_mqtt_config.h`
- Configurable validation thresholds
- Tunable retry and timeout parameters
- Precision control for data transmission

### 3. Message Validation
- Size validation for incoming MQTT messages
- Payload bounds checking
- Enhanced command processing with error handling

### 4. Connection Monitoring
- Network state tracking
- Connection quality monitoring
- Automatic reconnection with backoff

## Configuration Constants

The new `custom_mqtt_config.h` file provides centralized configuration:

```c
// Data validation thresholds
#define MQTT_TEMP_MIN_CELSIUS           -50.0
#define MQTT_TEMP_MAX_CELSIUS           100.0
#define MQTT_HUMIDITY_MIN_PERCENT       0.0
#define MQTT_HUMIDITY_MAX_PERCENT       100.0
#define MQTT_PRESSURE_MIN_PA            80000.0
#define MQTT_PRESSURE_MAX_PA            120000.0

// Connection parameters  
#define MQTT_RECONNECT_BASE_DELAY_SEC   5
#define MQTT_RECONNECT_MAX_DELAY_SEC    300
#define MQTT_MAX_PUBLISH_FAILURES       10
#define MQTT_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SEC     30
```

## Performance Improvements

### 1. Reduced Data Noise
- Limited precision for floating-point values to reduce JSON size
- Filtered out obviously invalid readings
- Consolidated validation logic

### 2. Better Resource Usage
- Implemented proper memory cleanup
- Added heap monitoring
- Optimized JSON message structure

### 3. Network Efficiency
- Added message sequence numbers for debugging
- Implemented proper QoS handling
- Enhanced publish acknowledgment tracking

## Debugging Features

### 1. Enhanced Logging
- Detailed error reporting with context
- Sequence number tracking
- Failure rate monitoring
- State transition logging

### 2. Diagnostic Data
- Publish failure statistics
- Network connection status
- Memory usage reporting
- Connection quality metrics

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Data Validation Testing
- Test with out-of-range sensor values
- Verify NaN/infinite value handling
- Test GPS coordinate validation
- Verify battery percentage limits

### 2. Connection Stability Testing
- Test network disconnection/reconnection
- Verify exponential backoff behavior
- Test MQTT broker disconnection handling
- Verify message queuing during outages

### 3. Performance Testing
- Monitor memory usage over time
- Test with high-frequency sensor data
- Verify message sequence integrity
- Test concurrent module operation

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
- Power data processing now uses `percentage` field instead of `voltage`/`level`
- Enhanced validation may reject previously accepted invalid data
- New mutex requirements may affect timing slightly

### Compatibility
- All existing MQTT broker configurations remain compatible
- JSON message format enhanced but backward compatible
- Zbus channel interfaces unchanged

## Production Deployment Checklist
